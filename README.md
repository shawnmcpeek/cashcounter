# cashcounter
This is a simple script/program to count USD (and I think CAN) when you collect larger amounts of bills and coins.
As someone that does the monies for a local non-profit, I have to count the money when we run an event.
It is much easier to count by the number of each bill instead of my amount and less chance of mistakes. 
I was thinking that it would be really easy if there was a program or app for me to enter data in to instead of on paper.
I created this code in about 20 minutes without help (that's really good for me) and got a little help to polish it up and correct errors.
I also figured out, when my wife was playing with it, that I needed to change the checks amount to a float so that checks can be non-round numbers.
I converted it to an EXE file as well so I can run it easily on my computer.
Enjoy!
